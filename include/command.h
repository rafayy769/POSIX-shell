 * @brief This struct represents a simple command.
 * 
 * A simple command is a command/process with its args and its set of file descriptors. Different simple commands can be combined together by pipes to form a pipeline. For example, `ls -l` is a simple command, while `ls -l | grep a` is not a simple command.
 * 
 * IO redirection is handled by the shell, not by the command itself. So, the command will just have the file descriptors, and the shell will handle the redirection.

 * A command chain's grammar can be like:
 * Command [(; OR || OR &&) Command]*

 * Please note that only ';' chained commands can have an asynchronous first command. For example, `ls -l &; echo hello` is a valid command chain, but `ls -l & && echo hello` is not a valid command chain.

 * 3. If the chaining operator is '||', the immediate RHS is only executed if the last executed command fails. If the last executed command succeeds, then the RHS is not executed (skippped) and the chain traversal continues.
